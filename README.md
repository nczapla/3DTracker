3DTracker
=========

We used our beta.py file to run the program. To make the program work in python:
1. "run beta.py"
2. "beta('file name of the data',# of points you want to run the program through)"

ex-
for me, I saved the data as NIFFTE.txt and in class I showed one track which is up through the first 100
points so I typed-
In [1]: beta.py
In [2]: beta('NIFFTE.txt',100)
